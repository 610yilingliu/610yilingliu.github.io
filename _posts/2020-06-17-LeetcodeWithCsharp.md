# Introduction About this Series

I am experienced in Python3 but a starter of C#, and found there are too few C# solutions for Leetcode problems, so I decide to write those tutorials for those who want to learn algorithms & data structure through C#.

This collections records my daily practice and throughts about Leetcode problems through C#, including all difficulties. Please tell me if you got some benefit or have any problem with my solutions(Even typo, English grammer problems, etc. I am not a native English speaker), I will be happy to hear you :)

The basic grammer & environment setup could be found on those sources:

C#刷遍Leetcode面试题系列连载（1） - 入门与工具简介(Simplified Chinese, please open Google Translate if you cannot read it)

These source introduces how to set up C# environment for Leetcode problems and how to test it.
