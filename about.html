    <p><h2> About Me</h2></p>

    <p>HeyÔºåI am <strong>Yiling(È£éÈÄùÊó†ÊÆá)</strong>ÔºåA postgraduate student studying in the University of Western Australia majored in Information Technology.</p>

    <p>I love animals, but have no time to keep a pet at home right now.</p>

    <p>I was majored in math when I was a undergraduate student, but I thought it was boring so I became a hard core game player ‚Äî‚Äî almost professional, while studying in Xiamen University. After graduation, I was hired by a game company as a game designer. While working with programmers at the workplace, I found coding is cool and it is able to make life easier. Because of that, I chose Information Technology as my major when I applied UWA as my grad school.</p>
    <p>The reason why I was attached by Machine Learning is quite accident, I thought the house I lived was too expensive at the time I just went to Australia, so I wrote a web crawler to get the data from websites which rent houses. I had a unit called 'Data Science' at the first semester. <a href="https://directory.uwa.edu.au/view?dn=cn%3DWei%20Liu%2Cou%3DComputer%20Science%20and%20Software%20Engineering%2Cou%3DSchool%20of%20Physics%5C2C%20Mathematics%20and%20Computing%2Cou%3DFaculty%20of%20Engineering%20and%20Mathematical%20Sciences%2Cou%3DFaculties%2Co%3DThe%20University%20of%20Western%20Australia">Dr Wei Liu</a>, the unit coordinator, encouraged me to have a try and gave me some suggestion of variables I should use. So I found Data Science was amazing and fall in love with it :)</p>

    Send a private message to my Twitter account [@WindyYiling](https://twitter.com/WindyYiling) if you are willing to hire me. Too much junk mail inside my inbox so I am afraid that I cannot see your mail at once.</p>

    <p>This blog only updates when I have time and found things that I think is helpful for others to study computer science.</p>
    <p>I <b>HATE</b> the tutorials with a lots of formula and math, so I will explain things as simple as it could be</p>
    <p>I wish all of you could enjoy and get some knowledge through my posts. Everything I posted in this blog are free, and will be free forever. Just attach my name, Yiling and the original link of the post if you want to put it in other places.</p>
